preRun:
  # SECONDLY - You need to set the preRun commands. These are shell commands executed inside the root level of your git repository before running the tests. preRun commands are executed using non-login shells by default, so you must explicitly source any dotfiles as part of the command.

    - "go get -d ./..."

postMerge:
  # THIRDLY - You need to set postMerge patterns.
  # These would be the glob patterns for the test cases that you want to execute in the post-merge jobs. A postMerge test execution job is initiated whenever a PR is merged into a branch.
  pattern:
    # glob-patterns to discover tests to run in case of postMerge.
